## What I learned + What I had a hard time with
- Figure out how to make a menu transition. (Attemped to implement it with CSS only, but cannot find the way.)
- How to put a favicon.
- As making hamburger lines using `::before` `::after` pseudo, it didn't appear unless setting `display` property.
- To make a checkbox (toggler) clickable, it needed to be the top of every elements.
