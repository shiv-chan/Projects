			<h1>Parallax Scrolling Effect</h1>
			<p>
				Parallax is a
				displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed
				along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or
				semi-angle of inclination between those two lines.[1][2] Due to
				foreshortening, nearby objects show a larger parallax than farther
				objects when observed from different positions, so parallax can be used
				to determine distances.
			</p>

			<p>
				To measure large distances, such as the distance of a planet or a star
				from Earth, astronomers use the principle of parallax. Here, the term
				parallax is the semi-angle of inclination between two sight-lines to the
				star, as observed when Earth is on opposite sides of the Sun in its
				orbit.[a] These distances form the lowest rung of what is called "the
				cosmic distance ladder", the first in a succession of methods by which
				astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects, serving as a
				basis for other distance measurements in astronomy forming the higher
				rungs of the ladder.
			</p>

			<p>
				Parallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes,
				binoculars, microscopes, and twin-lens reflex cameras that view objects
				from slightly different angles. Many animals, along with humans, have
				two eyes with overlapping visual fields that use parallax to gain depth
				perception; this process is known as stereopsis. In computer vision the
				effect is used for computer stereo vision, and there is a device called
				a parallax rangefinder that uses it to find range, and in some
				variations also altitude to a target.
			</p>

			<p>
				A simple everyday example of parallax can be seen in the dashboard of
				motor vehicles that use a needle-style non-LCD speedometer gauge. When
				viewed from directly in front, the speed may show exactly 60, but when
				viewed from the passenger seat' the needle may appear to show a slightly
				different speed, due to the angle of viewing.
